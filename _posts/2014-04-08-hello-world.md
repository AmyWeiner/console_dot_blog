## Who I am

My name is Amy Weiner, and I am currently residing in the San Francisco Bay Area. I graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, CT with a bachelor's degree in Jewish Studies, and thereafter, attended Stanford University, where I received a master's of science degree in Environmental Engineering. 

My passions include fitness, travel, programming, technology, and renewable energy and sustainability development. Some of my hobbies are cooking, reading, and home improvement/DIY-type projects. In order to relax, I enjoy watching television and movies, especially documentary films, and drinking a nice glass of wine, or single malt whisky.

I recently completed the [General Assembly Web Development Immersive Program](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive), and am now seeking employment as a web application developer/software engineer, ideally in the energy sector.

## Why I am Blogging

My motivaiton for starting this blog is threefold. First of all, I intend for it to serve as an archive of my experiences as a programmer and web application developer, which hopefully will provide other coders and developers with helpful information and insight, when building their own projects. Secondly, I plan on utilizing this blog as an opportunity to increase my online presence in the web development community. Finally, I aim to utilize this blog as a platform for learning about and discussing new web development techniques, practices, and technologies.
