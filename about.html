  <blockquote>I graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, CT with a bachelor's degree in Jewish Studies, and thereafter, attended Stanford University, where I received a master's of science degree in Environmental Engineering. Upon completing the General Assembly Web Development Immersive course, I started this blog in order offer tips, advice, and general musings vis-Ã -vis my experiences as a web application developer.</blockquote> }

   <blockquote>My passions include fitness, travel, programming, technology, and renewable energy and sustainability development. Some of my hobbies are cooking, reading, and home improvement/DIY-type projects. In order to relax, I enjoy watching television and movies, especially documentary films, and drinking a nice glass of wine, or single malt whisky. My ideal job is one that involves working as a software engineer in the clean tech or alternative energy sector. </blockquote>}
